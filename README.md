# Consumer-Producer-thread-demo

### **Idea**
the idea came when i was watching coding jesus video and he was discussing a similar senario about how a producer and consumer thread would correlate (the question they discussed was way deeper than this implementaion ), at the meanwhile i was reading about conditional variables to i decided to do this project

### **OverView**
this project uses Windows api functions of critical sections & conditional varaibles, it also implents a queue in C structure , and inserting randomness in consumer and producer working flow

### **Final words**
i decided to publish this simple demo to help out people who are beginning like me to help each other with code , any issues or improvements submited about the code would be appriciated :)
